          Cozym Limited is a 100% Nigerian indigenous company delivering oil and
          gas infrastructure that powers Nigeria’s energy future. Established in
          2012, the company began with a strong foundation in water and
          environmental engineering projects before strategically transitioning
          into engineering consultancy for the oil and gas sector. This
          evolution reflects our adaptability, technical breadth, and drive to
          deliver solutions where they matter most.
